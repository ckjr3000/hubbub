<p>Blue Ruth is the semi-improv, synth-led, industrial punk project of Birmingham musician Kaila Whyte of Brummie punk band, Youth Man and queer noise trio, Pretty Grim.</p>

<p>Through a distorted cacophony of sound, Blue Ruth fights against analogue synthesizers and drum machines to deliver part-autobiographical, part-abstract stories about sex, drugs and chronic illness in a delightfully morbid vision of their life and hometown.</p>
