<p>
    I. Nakhla is an artist working on the fringes of music, computational arts, and sculpture. Nakhla uses
    sound and music to access forms of teleportation, moving through time whilst shape-shifting and
    magnifying ‘voice’ as an act of techno-feminist protest and play. Through collaboration and
    improvisation, Nakhla contextualises sound and music as transitory places, prompting questions
    about what we consider to be space, place and exhibition. Their work aims to queer the exhibition
    format, searching for socially and materially specific spaces to host sculptural-sound through
    interventions that insist on active pasts and urgent presences. Nakhla also works under the moniker
    end measure.
