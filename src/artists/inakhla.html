    <p>
        I. Nakhla is an artist working on the fringes of music, computational arts, and sculpture. Nakhla uses
        sound and music to access forms of teleportation, moving through time whilst shape-shifting and
        magnifying ‘voice’ as an act of techno-feminist protest and play. 
    </p>
    <p>  
        Through collaboration and improvisation, Nakhla contextualises sound and music as transitory places, prompting questions
        about what we consider to be space, place and exhibition. Their work aims to queer the exhibition
        format, searching for socially and materially specific spaces to host sculptural-sound through
        interventions that insist on active pasts and urgent presences. Nakhla also works under the moniker
        end measure.
    </p>
    <p>
        For their 2023 Digital Gardens Residency with ame, I. Nakhla asks what it means to have a voice and
        be vocal. Their project builds on their research into the agitations that relate rhythm, sound,
        pattern, and vibration.
