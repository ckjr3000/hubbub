<p>
    digital selves is a London-based musician who uses live coded algorithms to create computer music. 
    Using the functional programming mini-language TidalCycles they create computer music through live coded 
    algorithms re-contextualising club culture, experimental art and human-computer interaction.

<p>
    Some recent works include commissions on Art and AI exploring ritual and collective intelligence, a recent feature 
    in Fact Magazineâ€™s Artist DIY series, musical releases on the Cherche Encore and in.unision labels, and hosting feminist hackathons.
