<p>
    For many years, Bear Kenchington (previously known as Sarah Kenchington) has been working in the field of human powered, 
    mechanically assisted acoustic instruments. They are interested in how, in this relationship, the humans are mechanised 
    and the machines are humanised. They never use electricity or any form of digital technologies in their instruments, 
    although they often explore similar sound worlds, loops, drones, non-specific pitch and song noise.
</p>
<p>
    They describe their work as post-digital, imagining the machines in a future world making music for renegade humans 
    hiding in caves from the robots.
